# sql-and-data-notes-and-samples
My collection of SQL Samples &amp; Notes.

This is largely unsorted, and with minimal documentation. I just wanted to host samples somewhere I could share and reference. 

Some samples may use now deprecated functions, or there may be better/newer functionality available: 
* **Oracle** code may go back to `11g`/`12c` (Check out the [Oracle_Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database) page on wikipedia for versions). 
* **SQL Server** notes go as far back as SQL Server 2005 when I started using it for Business Intelligence and (what is now known as) Analytics Engineering.
* **MySQL** notes &amp; samples may go back to 2008.
* **SnowFlake** notes are more recent (since early 2020s)

# Executing SQL Examples
In most cases there is a fiddle/online tool. In other cases (particularly user admin), I'd recommend running your own instance.

## Fiddle Locations
There is also a [fiddle](https://fiddles.io) for most things.

* https://www.db-fiddle.com/ : MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
* http://sqlfiddle.com/ : SQL Server, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Oracle PLSQL
* http://rextester.com/l/sql_server_online_compiler : SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle (Note: Oracle; This language is for patrons only)

## Oracle

Note Oracle Free is limited for storage and hardware. Great for testing, but probably will have issues in most production applications. There is also Oracle Cloud (which allows you to have a free database there).
